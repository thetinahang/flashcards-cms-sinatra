# Flashy Flashcards Sinatra 

I developed this CMS app with Ruby and Sinatra, as my Sinatra final project. I have been studying for the GRE exam and thought that developing this was better than wasting notecards. I have been trying to use less paper this year (2018). Please feel free to give it a try and let me know if there needs to be any revisions. 

## Instructions 
To load this app, run "bundle install", "rake db:migrate", and then "shotgun" to get started.
