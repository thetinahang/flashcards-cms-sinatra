# Flashy Flashcards Sinatra 

I developed this CMS app with Ruby and Sinatra, as my Sinatra final project. I have been studying for the GRE exam and thought that developing this was better than wasting notecards. I have been trying to use less paper this year (2018). 

Each user can develop their own "stack" of "flashcards". The user can have many stacks and the stack can have many flashcards. A stack belongs to a user and a flashcard belongs to a stack. 

Please feel free to give it a try and let me know if there needs to be any revisions. 

## Instructions 
To load this app, run "bundle install", "rake db:migrate", and then "shotgun" to get started.
